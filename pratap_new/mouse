Hi,

I am practicing git in the central repository.

Practicing this to get a job with better package.

Also need to change my domain to Devops.

Taking 3 months of time to prapare for this devop from today (i.e., 18th July, 2024)

Hope I could finish this course by watching and practicing with Madhu kiranand Ramani's support without getting deviation. I wish I will be consistent and maintain the same excitement.
